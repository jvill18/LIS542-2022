            <p>Had good school. Sunny in the morning – clouded in afternoon. At noon <name role="student">Irwin</name> and <name role="student">Roy</name> tried to see who could act the "biggest monkey." Rode horse, rubbed him down, jumped rope (buggy line) and so-forth. <name>Lou</name> and <name>Lillie</name> fixed minutes of last evening Society met. – Turned <name>Lillie</name>'s watch back with mine. – <name>Jesse</name> laughs at me about being always hungry. <name>Nellie</name> and <name>Mary</name> went to church. <name>J</name> called us "Back woodsers" I replied, that I would rather be

            a "backwoodser" than a "heathen". We went down to the school house. Not many there; had no meeting. Went to <name>Mr. Strate's</name>. Had music. Laughed at Joe and Charlie about going to "Hunt"('s) Charlie has <name>concluded</name> he would rather Hunt than fish, so he's not been lately seen going up the creek. – We suppose it is because the fish are all "Young." When we started home it was raining. <name>John</name> <name>Dollie</name> and I came across the pasture. (<name>Dollie</name> thought we were going to <place>China</place>.) <name>Joe</name> asked what I had been saying about Kentuckians. Peek's brought <name>Mary</name> and <name>Nellie</name> home. <name>John Whitehouse</name> was converted. (<name>John W.</name> came to school this evening for <name>Lou</name> and <name>Lillie</name>.</p></entry>

            <p>Dark and rainy. Had twenty pupils. <name role="student">Irwin</name>, <name role="student">Walter</name>, <name role="student">Charlie</name>, <name role="student">Roy</name> + <name role="student">John</name> went down the road and came back after school had called. <name role="student">Roy</name> and <name role="student">John</name> tried themselves. –I was doubly kind, in my actions, but, inwardly, I burned with anger. After school I traced pencil marks in register. As I started, I asked if I had made any missteps, or done the least thing to cause such actions as had transpired. The reply, "Nothing. Not a thing, they just took a notion to be mean." A I came across the bridge I sat on the banister and watched the water flow over the rocks. I read the <place>Modesto</place> paper. Jesse tried to make us believe he could not read. After supper he brought up "scripture
            
            <pb n="p05"/>
            
            argument; read two chapters from the <cite>Testament</cite>, asked our opinions, then gave us his explanation. Calls us "backwoodsers." We went to bed early. <name role="student">Lillie</name> did not come to school.</p></entry>

            <p>Dark and gloomy. Wish I could be at <place>Nilwood</place> to the Local Institute. I straightened up books and papers, put most of them in my valise. Had a talk with <name>Nellie</name> about school. (a perfect jewel, to be so good.) I fixed my tan skirt. <name>Jesse</name> went to <place>Modesto</place>. <name>Roy</name> cut wood. <name>Mary</name> baked all morning. (Had baked chicken for dinner, and I ate so much dinner that I was not hungry for supper. <name>Jess</name> said it was the first time he ever saw me not hungry) <name>Ed</name> came in the evening. He got letters from <name>Mamma</name>, <name>Ida</name> and <name>Katie M</name>. got school journal and circular from supt. <name>McClure</name>.

            told about hauling one of my pupils <addition placement="above">(Jermin)</addition> around in the big wagon. Laughed about him going to <place>Carlinville</place> on Tues., following the wagon-ride. <name>Joe</name> came home with <name>Jess</name>. Argued about "Back woodsers" and "Mountain heathens". They said <name>Dolly</name> got mad. The boys went to town. As they were starting, <name>Joe</name> was going to make me take back something; I made a certain remark which caused him to take sudden leave. Gave us oranges. <name>Dolly</name> and I went to church with <name>Ed</name>. Roads were very bad, and we went through the fields. <name role="preacher">Rhoads</name> preached, but got sick and <name role="preacher">King</name> took the meeting. Excellent meeting. Got home about eleven. Boys came before we went to bed. After noon <name>Lillie</name> came to tell us about going over

            to <place>Scottsville</place> to wait on her sick cousin. Wanted <name>Dollie</name> to take her part in the dialogue. Asked <name>Dollie</name> to bring her books. (Rocking chair proved to hold two) </p></entry>

They went in little bed room to read but we would not let them alone: they went out by the milk house and read, then gave us the book. <name>Mary</name> called on everybody to help put the hogs in the

            lot. <name>Dolly</name> went to put <name>Joe</name>'s hat on him and had to stand on the bench. Had dispute as to whether pancakes were baked, or fried: proved that bake is right. <name>Jess</name> says <name>Flo</name> is the only good looking girl in <place>Illinois</place>.<name> Mr. Essex</name>, the best looking man. <place>Kentucky</place> is noted for tobacco, whiskey and and big feet. <name>Jess</name> says "<name>Dollie</name> is - is - is, all right." "She's too smart to be called a backwoodser." <name>Roy</name>, <name>Nellie</name> and I are "Smart alecks." I went to bed at seven o clock.

            <p>Two or three inches of snow and still snowing. Trees and bushes look like Christmas trees. Snowed all day, but thawed more than it snowed</p>

            <p>Had a very small school, only eleven. Stopped to see <name>Mr. Strate</name>. Made short talk about conduct of Friday. Better results, but far from perfect. At noon, the girls were getting locks of everybody's hair. (<quote><cite source="conversation"/>If you'll come over after school is out, I'll give you a lock of my hair.</quote>) I was tired all day: about sick. After supper I wrote to mamma and to the girls. Talked of suicides. <name>Jess</name> said he had no sympathy for such people. Would not grieve if his own father committed suicide.</p>
